### Engine Resources
In this folder, there should be a structure that will be used platform angosticly to have the resources for the engine, such as app icon, fonts, base models,... whatever is required for engine to run with basics.

As a starting point, it will have the base folder of mipmap and icon for the Android apk to use, because I will use an icon later on.
